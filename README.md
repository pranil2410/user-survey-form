# user-survey-form
A lightweight form for collecting essential information: name, email, and contact number. It also includes a dropdown for selection, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a textarea for comments. HTML5 validation ensures correct input formatting, and the CSS is intentionally kept simple for learning purposes.
